        <p>In this second task, you are going to be presented with pairs of dollar amounts. We would like you to imagine that
you are actually going to be paid these dollar amounts based on your selection. One of the amounts
will be an amount that you could receive today. The other amount will be an amount that you could receive after a delay. For example,
you might be asked to choose between receiving $8 today, or $15 after a week.
The dollar amounts and time delays will vary from trial to trial.</p>





		<center> 

			<p> $8 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp $15</p>
      <p> Today &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In one week</p>

		</center>



		<p>Please use the left or right arrow keys to select the dollar amount that you would prefer. The left arrow key will select the dollar
amount on the left, and the right arrow key will select the dollar amount on the right. After you make your choice, you will be 
presented with another pair of dollar amounts. </p>



    <p>After pressing either the LEFT or the RIGHT arrow, you will be shown another pair of monetary values. There will <kbd>5</kbd> practice trials and <kbd>175</kbd> experimental trials. You will be prompted when the practice trials are over and the experimental trials begin. Though the total time on task varies from person to person, on average, this task will take <kbd>8-12</kbd> minutes. </p>

		<p><b>Please respond as quickly and as accurately as possible. </b></p>

		<p>After the completion of the experimental round, you will be given a Qualtrics authentication code to use to complete the third part of our HIT.</p>

    <p>Please note that your answers to these questions will not affect your compensation for this study. </p>
