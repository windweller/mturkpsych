MTurk Psych [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/windweller/mturkpsych.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/windweller/mturkpsych.svg?branch=master)  
==========

This website is used to run the Psychology experiment (mTurk tasks). It is built purely using Spray REST API library and Spray-Can as the server. This website leverages Akka's incredible Actor concurrency and ditched traditional MVC framework to embrace JavaScript endpoint construction.

The JavaScript file is written in complete future style with q.js and jQuery, and the URI routing is completely independent (except the one endpoint).

The frontend framework is Zurb Foundation 5, which I start to dislike. Anyway, please let me know if you intend to download or use this in any way.
